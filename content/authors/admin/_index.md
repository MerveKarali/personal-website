I am an AI Researcher & Data Engineer, holding an M.Sc. degree in Computer Science from the Technical University of Munich. My research focuses on the intersection of Deep Learning and Computer Vision. In my master's thesis, I specialized in robust techniques to enhance label propagation under limited supervision, integrating multimodality for semantic segmentation.

Simultaneously, I've navigated the landscape of enterprise ML/AI and data engineering. As an AI Researcher, I contributed to projects like FunKI and 6G-SKY, exploring deep image processing techniques, image super-resolution, image restoration, and Trustworthy AI, with a focus on Explainable AI for computer vision. Bridging the gap between research and production, I worked on projects automating ultrasonic testing analysis using CNNs and Transformers.

With eight years of experience as a Data Engineer, I've led initiatives in Data Warehouse, ETL, and Big Data across diverse domains such as banking, telecommunication, e-commerce, and health. Whether as a consultant or part of a corporation, I've acted as a lead analytics engineer, designing and developing analytical solutions and datasets. My proficiency spans Python, SQL, Google Cloud Platform, and AWS.

Beyond the tech realm, I find joy in math, computing, engaging conversations, reading, cooking, hitting the gym, and more.
