I am an AI Researcher & Data Engineer, holding an M.Sc. degree in Computer Science from the <a href="https://www.tum.de/en/">Technical University of Munich</a>. My research delves into the convergence of Deep Learning and Computer Vision, with a specialization in unsupervised and self-supervised learning, multi-modal data learning, and semantic segmentation.

In my professional journey, I've seamlessly navigated the realms of enterprise ML/AI and data engineering. As an AI Researcher, my contributions to projects like <a href="https://www.funki.tech/">FunKI</a> and <a href="https://www.6g-sky.net/">6G-SKY</a> include exploring advanced image processing techniques, such as image super-resolution, restoration, and Trustworthy AI, with a particular emphasis on Explainable AI in computer vision. Bridging the research-production gap, I've actively engaged in projects automating ultrasonic testing analysis using CNNs and Transformers.

With eight years of experience as a Data Engineer, I've spearheaded initiatives in Data Warehouse, ETL, and Big Data across diverse sectors, including banking, telecommunication, e-commerce, and healthcare. My skill set encompasses proficiency in Python, SQL, Google Cloud Platform, and AWS.
