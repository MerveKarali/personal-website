The Laboratory Diagnostics project involved a collaborative effort with a global team from a prominent healthcare company. The project's primary focus was to migrate laboratory diagnostic data into a Snowflake data lake. The implementation included setting up Extract, Load, Transform (ELT) pipelines within Snowflake and reconstructing sections of the business logic to accurately replicate key performance indicators (KPIs) and analytics. This endeavor aimed to streamline data management processes, enhance analytics capabilities, and contribute to more efficient and informed decision-making in the realm of laboratory diagnostics.
