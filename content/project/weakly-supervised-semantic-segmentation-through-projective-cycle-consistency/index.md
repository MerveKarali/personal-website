The project aims to achieve semantic segmentation using sparse annotations by implementing knowledge transfer mechanisms between multiple 2D images and 3D point clouds through projective cycle consistency. The focus is on leveraging the information from both modalities to enhance the segmentation process, ultimately improving the model's ability to understand and categorize the visual elements within the data.
